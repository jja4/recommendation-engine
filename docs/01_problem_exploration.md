# Problem Exploration

## Core Problem

New users drop off after the first two weeks. This signals a failure to create a reward loop or deliver convincing value within the early activation window. If users don't experience quick wins or a reason to return, the perceived cost of continued engagement exceeds the perceived benefit.

The core challenge is **aligning the app's first session(s) with what users actually need**—reducing friction, delivering immediate relevance, and helping them build early habits before motivation fades. When users don't quickly see "how does this app benefit *me*," they disengage before any long-term habits can emerge.

**Content is king.** The quality and relevance of what users experience determines whether they return. 

## Assumptions (Given Limited Context)

1. **Multiple value pathways exist** — The app offers diverse content (fitness, nutrition, sleep, stress), and only some resonate with each individual user.

2. **Early sessions are disproportionately important** — Churn predominantly occurs within the first 1–3 sessions. Users who don't find value quickly rarely return.

3. **One-size-fits-all fails** — Users arrive with diverse goals and mental models; a static onboarding flow cannot serve everyone effectively.

4. **Content exists but isn't matched well** — The app likely has good content, but surfacing the *right* content to the *right* user at the *right* time is the gap.

5. **Early experience is malleable** — Changes in first-session content can meaningfully influence long-term retention.

## Signals for Personalizing Early Experience

Personalization should leverage both explicit and implicit signals that emerge immediately.

### Explicit Signals (User-Provided)

| Signal | Example Values | Use Case |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| Declared goal | weight_loss, stress_reduction, better_sleep, build_strength | Primary content category selection 
| Demographic data | age, gender, height, weight | Personalization and segmentation |


### Implicit Behavioral Signals (Observed)

| Signal | What It Reveals | When Available |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| Time spent on content | Interest level, attention capacity | During first session |
| Preferred format | video, audio, article, interactive | Format prioritization |
| Content completion rate | Value delivery success | After first interaction |
| Exploration breadth | Curiosity vs. focus preference | First session |
| Skip/back behavior | Friction or mismatch indicators | Real-time |
| Return interval | Early habit formation | After first session |

### Derived Metrics

From these signals, we can quantify:

- **Early Perceived Value (EPV)**: How quickly does a user reach a "success moment" (e.g., completing a workout, finishing a meditation, logging a meal)?
- **Engagement Velocity**: Is interaction depth increasing or declining across early sessions?
- **Habit Formation Indicators**: Return cadence, consistent timing, repeated content types
